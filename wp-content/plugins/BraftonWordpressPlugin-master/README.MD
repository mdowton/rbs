#Options Explanation

##General:

-   Automatic Import: Must be turned on to enable the Importer to trigger with the Wordpress Sudo cron.

    -   Articles : Will trigger Hourly

    -   Videos: Will trigger 2x Daily

-   API Domain: Setting for registering the product brand your xml feed comes from

-   Importer User: Our content can sometimes contain html tags which Wordpress attempts to strip out when programmatically updating or inserting content. The importer user drop down allows you to select an administrator user to run the importer as during automation allowing you to receive all of your premium content.

    -   \*Note: Sometimes, although the user selected is an administrator, premium content can still be stripped out. If this is the case, simply select a different importer user, ideally the first administrator account that was set up with Wordpress.

    -   Note: If on a multisite the importer will automatically attempt to run the importer as a Network Administrator.

-   Import JQuery: Some of the features supported by the importer require a copy of jQuery to function. If a copy of jQuery is not loaded in the website turn this feature “on” to import a copy from Google’s Developer CDN (Content Delivery Network).

-   Add OG Tags: OG Tags are what social media sites (particularly Facebook) use to identify pieces of your content for use in sharing your content. Many SEO plugins already provide support for these however if you are not using one or prefer to use ours (which also supports twittercards and google+ items) select the “Add Tags” Option

-   Update Existing Content: This option will allow you to override your article content within the last 30 days or all of your video content with updated copies from your xml feed. We recommend keeping this option off.

    -   NOTE: If this option is enabled it will take more system resources to run as well as download fresh copies of the article or video images during each run.
